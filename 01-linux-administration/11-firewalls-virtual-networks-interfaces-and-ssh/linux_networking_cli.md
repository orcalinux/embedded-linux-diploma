## 1. Introduction

Linux networking can be entirely controlled via the command line. This document explains each tool and option in detail, ensuring you understand both the basics and the more advanced parameters. The guide is intended for system administrators, network engineers, and any users who wish to gain deeper insight into the workings of Linux networking.

## 2. Network Interface Management

### 2.1 Listing Network Interfaces

**Purpose:**  
Identify the network interfaces on your system along with their status.

**Commands:**

-   **`ip` Command:**

    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```

    **Explanation & Options:**

    -   `ip`: A modern utility from the iproute2 suite used to manage networking.
    -   `link`: Focuses on network device operations.
    -   `show`: Lists all available network interfaces, including their state (UP/DOWN), MAC address, and other attributes.

-   **`ifconfig` Command:**

    ```bash
    ifconfig -a
    ```

    **Explanation & Options:**

    -   `ifconfig`: Traditional command-line tool for network configuration.
    -   `-a`: Displays all interfaces, even those that are down.

    _Note: On many distributions, `ifconfig` may require the installation of the `net-tools` package._

---

### 2.2 Enabling/Disabling Interfaces

**Purpose:**  
Activate or deactivate a specific network interface.

**Commands:**

-   **Using `ip`:**

    ```bash
    sudo ip link set dev <interface> up
    sudo ip link set dev <interface> down
    ```

    **Explanation & Options:**

    -   `set`: Modifies the state of the interface.
    -   `dev <interface>`: Specifies the device (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
    -   `up` / `down`: Brings the interface online or offline.

-   **Using `ifconfig`:**
    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig <interface> up
    sudo ifconfig <interface> down
    ```
    **Explanation:**  
    Similar to the `ip` commands, this brings an interface up or down but is based on the older `net-tools` package.

---

### 2.3 Configuring IP Addresses

**Purpose:**  
Assign static or dynamic IP addresses to your network interfaces.

**Commands:**

-   **Using `ip`:**

    ```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev <interface>
    sudo ip link set <interface> up
    ```

    **Explanation & Options:**

    -   `addr add`: Adds a new IP address to the specified interface.
    -   `192.168.1.100/24`: IP address with CIDR notation (CIDR provides both IP and netmask).
    -   `dev <interface>`: Specifies which interface to configure.

-   **Using `ifconfig`:**
    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    ```
    **Explanation & Options:**
    -   `<interface> 192.168.1.100`: Assigns the IP address to the interface.
    -   `netmask 255.255.255.0`: Defines the subnet mask.
    -   `up`: Activates the interface immediately after setting the IP.

_For persistent configurations, refer to your distribution’s network configuration files (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces`, Netplan files on Ubuntu, or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` on Red Hat-based systems)._

---

## 3. Hostname and DNS Configuration

### 3.1 Managing Hostnames

**Purpose:**  
Set or change the system’s hostname.

**Commands:**

-   **Temporarily changing the hostname:**

    ```bash
    sudo hostname <newhostname>
    ```

    **Explanation:**  
    Changes the hostname for the current session.

-   **Using `hostnamectl` (persistent change):**
    ```bash
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>
    ```
    **Explanation & Options:**
    -   `hostnamectl`: A utility to query and change the system hostname.
    -   `set-hostname <newhostname>`: Permanently updates the hostname across reboots.

### 3.2 Editing the Hosts File

**Purpose:**  
Map hostnames to IP addresses before DNS resolution is used.

**File Location:**  
`/etc/hosts`

**Example Entry:**

```
192.168.1.10   myserver.local
```

**Explanation:**  
This file is processed locally, ensuring certain hostnames resolve without querying an external DNS server.

### 3.3 DNS Setup

**Purpose:**  
Define how your system resolves domain names to IP addresses.

**File Location:**  
`/etc/resolv.conf`

**Explanation:**

-   Direct editing of `/etc/resolv.conf` can be temporary since many systems use dynamic managers (NetworkManager or systemd-resolved).
-   For persistent changes, use your distribution’s network configuration tools (e.g., Netplan for Ubuntu).

## 4. Testing Connectivity

### 4.1 Ping Command

**Purpose:**  
Test connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests to a target.

**Command:**

```bash
ping <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

-   Sends packets and reports round-trip time (RTT).
-   Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the command.
-   Options like `-c <count>` can limit the number of pings (e.g., `ping -c 4 google.com`).

### 4.2 Traceroute

**Purpose:**  
Determine the route packets take to reach a network host.

**Command:**

```bash
traceroute <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

-   Displays each hop along the path.
-   Options like `-m <max hops>` can set the maximum number of hops (e.g., `traceroute -m 15 google.com`).

### 4.3 MTR

**Purpose:**  
Combine the functionalities of `ping` and `traceroute` for real-time network path analysis.

**Command:**

```bash
mtr <ip-address or hostname>
```

**Explanation:**  
Provides a continuously updated view of the route and latency at each hop. Options allow changing the reporting interval and packet size.

-   `-u`: Lists UDP connections.
-   `-l`: Shows only listening sockets.
-   `-p`: Displays the process using the socket.
-   `-n`: Uses numeric addresses instead of resolving hostnames.

### 5.2 ss Command

**Purpose:**  
Modern alternative to `netstat` for displaying socket statistics.

**Command:**

```bash
ss -tulpn
```

**Explanation:**  
Uses similar options to netstat with improved performance and additional filtering capabilities.

### 5.3 IP Route

**Purpose:**  
View and manage routing tables.

**Command:**

```bash
ip route show
```

**Explanation & Options:**

-   `ip route`: Manages routes in the kernel.
-   `show`: Lists all current routes.
-   You can add routes with:
    ```bash
    sudo ip route add <destination> via <gateway> dev <interface>
    ```
    This command explains how packets to `<destination>` are routed through a specified `<gateway>` on the given `<interface>`.

sudo tcpdump -i <interface>
```

**Explanation & Options:**

-   `-i <interface>`: Specifies which interface to capture packets from.
-   Additional options:
    -   `-w <file>`: Write the output to a file (e.g., `-w capture.pcap`).
    -   Filter expressions can narrow the capture (e.g., `tcpdump -i <interface> port 80`).

### 6.2 nmap

**Purpose:**

-   To change settings:
    ```bash
    sudo ethtool -s <interface> speed 100 duplex full autoneg off
    ```
    This command sets the interface to 100Mb/s full duplex with auto-negotiation disabled.

### 6.4 Wireless (iw)

**Purpose:**  
Manage and troubleshoot wireless interfaces.

**Commands:**

-   **List wireless devices:**
    ```bash
