- **Virtualization Software (Optional)**: Tools like VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, or KVM can be used to create isolated environments.
- **Administrative Access**: Ability to perform actions with `sudo` or root privileges.
- **Backup Copies**: Always back up important data before modifying firmware settings or system configurations.

### Software Tools

- **`mokutil`**: For managing Machine Owner Keys (MOK).
- **`sbsigntool`**: For signing binaries.
- **`openssl`**: For generating cryptographic keys and certificates.
- **`dmesg`**, **`bootctl`**, and other utilities for verifying Secure Boot status.

## Demo Overview

The demonstration is divided into five parts:

1. **Introduction to Secure Boot**: Theoretical background and importance.
2. **Secure Boot Enabled Scenario**: Showcasing normal operation with Secure Boot.
3. **Secure Boot Disabled Scenario**: Demonstrating system behavior without Secure Boot.
4. **Simulating a Bootkit Attack**: Introducing a malicious bootloader.
5. **Observing Secure Boot's Protection**: How Secure Boot prevents the attack.

**Note**: For safety and to prevent actual system compromise, use virtual machines or isolated test environments when simulating attacks.

## Step-by-Step Demonstration

### Part 1: Introduction to Secure Boot

**Objective**: Provide a foundational understanding of Secure Boot.

**Steps**:

1. **Explain Secure Boot**:

   - Definition: A UEFI firmware feature that ensures only trusted software is executed during the boot process.
   - Importance: Protects against low-level attacks like bootkits and rootkits that can compromise the entire system.

2. **Discuss the Boot Process with and without Secure Boot**:

   - Without Secure Boot: The firmware loads the bootloader, which in turn loads the kernel and OS. This process is vulnerable to tampering.
   - With Secure Boot: Each component in the boot chain is signed and verified, ensuring integrity.

3. **Highlight Real-World Implications**:
   - Example attacks that Secure Boot can prevent.
   - Importance in enterprise and sensitive environments.

### Part 2: Secure Boot Enabled Scenario

**Objective**: Demonstrate normal system behavior with Secure Boot enabled.

**Steps**:

1. **Verify Secure Boot Status**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mokutil
   mokutil --sb-state
   ```

   _Expected Output_:

   ```
   SecureBoot enabled
   ```

2. **Show Trusted Boot Components**:

   - List signed bootloader and kernel files.
   - Explain how they are verified during the boot process.

3. **Run a System Update**:

   - Perform a standard update to show that signed updates work seamlessly.

   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

   _Explain_: Updates are signed, maintaining the Secure Boot trust chain.

### Part 3: Secure Boot Disabled Scenario

**Objective**: Illustrate system behavior without Secure Boot and set the stage for simulating an attack.

**Steps**:

1. **Disable Secure Boot**:

   - **Note**: This step requires rebooting into UEFI firmware settings.
   - **Instructions**:
     - Restart the system.
     - Enter UEFI settings (commonly by pressing `F2`, `F10`, `Del`, or `Esc` during boot).
     - Navigate to the `Security` or `Boot` tab.
     - Disable **Secure Boot**.
     - Save changes and exit.

2. **Verify Secure Boot is Disabled**:

   ```bash
   mokutil --sb-state
   ```

   _Expected Output_:

   ```
   SecureBoot disabled
   ```

3. **Explain the Implications**:
   - Without Secure Boot, the system no longer verifies the integrity of boot components.
   - Increases vulnerability to unauthorized or malicious software during boot.

### Part 4: Simulating a Bootkit Attack

**Objective**: Demonstrate how a malicious bootloader can compromise the system when Secure Boot is disabled.

**Steps**:

**Disclaimer**: This simulation is for educational purposes only. Ensure it is conducted in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, to prevent actual system compromise.

1. **Create a Malicious Bootloader**:

   - For simulation, use a benign script to represent a malicious bootloader.

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/malicious_bootloader
   cd ~/malicious_bootloader
   echo -e "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Malicious Bootloader Executed' > /tmp/malicious.log" > malicious_bootloader.sh
   chmod +x malicious_bootloader.sh
   ```

2. **Replace the Legitimate Bootloader**:

   - **Warning**: This step can render the system unbootable. Only perform in a VM.

   ```bash
   sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/<distribution>/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/<distribution>/grubx64.efi.bak
   sudo cp ~/malicious_bootloader/malicious_bootloader.sh /boot/efi/EFI/<distribution>/grubx64.efi
   ```

   _Replace `<distribution>` with your Linux distro's folder name._

3. **Reboot the System**:

   - Upon reboot, the malicious bootloader executes instead of the legitimate one.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Observe the Effects**:

   - After reboot, check for the presence of `/tmp/malicious.log`.

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/malicious.log
   ```

   _Expected Output_:

   ```
   Malicious Bootloader Executed
   ```

5. **Explain the Simulation**:
   - The malicious bootloader was able to execute arbitrary commands because Secure Boot was disabled.
   - In a real attack, such a bootkit could install rootkits, steal data, or further compromise the system.

### Part 5: Observing Secure Boot's Protection

**Objective**: Show how Secure Boot prevents unauthorized bootloader modifications.

**Steps**:

1. **Re-enable Secure Boot**:

   - Restart the system.
   - Enter UEFI firmware settings.
   - Enable **Secure Boot**.
   - Save changes and exit.

2. **Attempt to Replace the Bootloader Again**:

   ```bash
   sudo cp ~/malicious_bootloader/malicious_bootloader.sh /boot/efi/EFI/<distribution>/grubx64.efi
   ```

3. **Reboot the System**:

   - With Secure Boot enabled, the firmware should detect the unsigned bootloader and prevent it from executing.
   - The system should either refuse to boot or revert to the legitimate bootloader.

4. **Verify the Protection**:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

   - Upon reboot, check if the system boots normally without executing the malicious script.

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/malicious.log
   ```

   _Expected Output_:

   ```
   cat: /tmp/malicious.log: No such file or directory
   ```

5. **Explain the Outcome**:
   - Secure Boot prevented the execution of the unauthorized bootloader.
   - The malicious script did not run, maintaining system integrity.

## Best Practices for Instructors

To ensure an effective and safe demonstration:

1. **Use Virtual Machines**:

   - Conduct simulations in VMs to prevent accidental system damage.
   - Tools like VirtualBox or VMware are ideal for creating isolated environments.

2. **Prepare Ahead**:

   - Test all commands and steps in a non-production environment.
   - Ensure you have recovery options, such as VM snapshots or live USBs, in case of failures.

3. **Emphasize Safety**:

   - Clearly communicate the risks of modifying boot components.
   - Encourage students to follow along in their own isolated setups.

4. **Provide Clear Instructions**:

   - Use step-by-step guides with screenshots if possible.
   - Offer troubleshooting tips for common issues.

5. **Encourage Critical Thinking**:
   - Ask students to consider scenarios where Secure Boot is essential.
   - Discuss the future of boot security and emerging threats.
