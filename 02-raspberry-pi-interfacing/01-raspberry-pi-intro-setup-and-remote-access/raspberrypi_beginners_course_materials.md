## Raspberry Pi Board

### Recommended Models

- **Raspberry Pi 5**  
  Available in the following configurations:

  - **2GB or 4GB RAM:** Ideal for most applications.
  - **8GB RAM:** Best suited for resource-intensive projects.

- **Older Models:**  
  If you already own a Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4, rest assured that these models are fully compatible with all course activities and projects.

> **Tip:** For new purchases, opting for the latest Raspberry Pi 5 can future-proof your projects.

## Power Supply

A stable power supply is critical for the reliable operation of your Raspberry Pi. **Do not** power your device directly from a computer’s USB port, as this may not provide sufficient current.

### Recommended Power Supply Specifications:

| **Raspberry Pi Model** | **Connector Type** | **Recommended Power Supply**             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Raspberry Pi 5**     | USB-C              | 5.1V – 5A (Official Adapter Recommended) |
| **Raspberry Pi 4**     | USB-C              | 5V – 3.0A (Minimum)                      |
| **Raspberry Pi 2, 3**  | Micro-USB          | 5V – 2.5A (Minimum)                      |

> **Note:** Although some smartphone chargers may work, using the official Raspberry Pi power adapter is highly recommended to avoid performance issues.

## Micro SD Card

The micro SD card is essential as it houses your operating system and storage for your projects.

### Recommended Specifications:

- **Speed Class:** Class **10** (look for a "10" inside a circle) or higher.
- **Capacity:** **16GB or 32GB** is sufficient for most applications.
- **Performance:** UHS **U3** (indicated by a "3" inside a "U" shape) is preferred for faster data access.

> **Warning:** Using a low-speed SD card can lead to performance bottlenecks and a sluggish operating system.

## Hardware Components

For experiments involving GPIO and other electronics, the following components are required:

- **1 Breadboard**
- **Assorted Jumper Wires:**
  - Male-to-Male
  - Male-to-Female
  - Female-to-Female
- **Resistors:**
  - **1kΩ** is recommended (alternatives: 330Ω or 470Ω)
- **3 LEDs:**
  - Any colors will work.
- **1 Push Button:**
  - Preferably with 4 legs for secure breadboard connections.

> **Suggestion:** Purchasing a comprehensive breadboard kit that includes these components can be both cost-effective and convenient.

## PIR Sensor (Optional)

For those interested in exploring motion detection experiments and incorporating them into final projects, consider the following:

- **1 PIR Sensor:**
  - Model: **HC-SR501**

> **Pro Tip:** It may be wise to purchase 2-3 units if you are opting for budget versions, as quality and sensitivity can vary between manufacturers.

---

## Pi Camera V3

The Pi Camera is essential for any project involving image capture or video streaming.

### Options:

1. **Standard Pi Camera V3** (Recommended for most users)
2. **NoIR Pi Camera V3:**
   - Ideal for low-light conditions, although note that the image quality may diminish under bright daylight conditions.

If you already have a **Pi Camera V1 or V2**, these are compatible with the course activities.

### Additional Consideration for Raspberry Pi 5:

- **Camera Cable Adapter:**
  - A **15-pin (1mm) to 22-pin (0.5mm)** adapter may be required for connecting older camera models to the Raspberry Pi 5.
