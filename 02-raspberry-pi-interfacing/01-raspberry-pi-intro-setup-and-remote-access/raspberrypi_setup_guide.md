## 6. Angry IP Scanner Setup

### Download Options & Installation Commands

1. **Download Angry IP Scanner:**  
   Visit the official download page: [https://angryip.org/download/#linux](https://angryip.org/download/#linux)  
   Choose the appropriate package for your system. For example, if you are using Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, download the **x86 64-bit DEB Package** (e.g., `ipscan_3.9.1_amd64.deb`).

2. **Open Terminal and Navigate to the Downloads Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd $HOME/Downloads/
   ```

3. **Install the Downloaded Package:**  
   For Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, run:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i ipscan_3.9.1_amd64.deb
   ```

4. **Fix Dependency Issues (if necessary):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

### Running Angry IP Scanner

- **Using the Installed Package:**  
  After installation, Angry IP Scanner creates a desktop entry under **Applications** (within **Internet** or **Networking**). You can also launch it from the terminal:

  ```bash
  ipscan
  ```

- **Using the Executable Jar:**  
  Launch the jar by double-clicking it or running:
  ```bash
  java -jar <jar-file>
  ```

### Additional Note for Raspbian/32-bit ARM

For Raspbian/32-bit ARM systems, when using the "any architecture" DEB package, you must use an older 32-bit build of SWT since the current versions provided by Bullseye no longer support 32-bit systems.

## 4. Finding the Raspberry Pi IP Address

To locate your Raspberry Pi's IP address, use Angry IP Scanner. This tool scans your network and identifies connected devices, including your Raspberry Pi.

---

## 5. Configuring Raspberry Pi for Remote Desktop Access

Once you have located your Raspberry Pi’s IP address using Angry IP Scanner, follow these steps to configure your device for remote desktop access:

1. **Connect via SSH:**  
   Open a terminal on your computer and connect to your Raspberry Pi by replacing `<raspberry_pi_ip>` with its actual IP address. For example:

   ```bash
   ssh pi@<raspberry_pi_ip>
   ```

   > **Note:** If your username is different (e.g., `mahmoud`), adjust the command accordingly.

2. **Launch the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool:**  
   Once connected via SSH, run:

   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```

3. **Set Boot Options for Desktop Autologin:**  
   In the `raspi-config` menu:

   - Navigate to **System Options**.
   - Select **Boot / Auto Login**.
   - Choose **Desktop Autologin** (which automatically logs you into the Desktop GUI as the default user).

4. **Enable VNC for Remote Desktop Access:**  
   In the same `raspi-config` menu:
   - Go to **Interface Options** (or **Interfacing Options**).
   - Select **VNC**.
   - Choose **Enable**.
   - Exit `raspi-config` and reboot if prompted.

After completing these steps, your Raspberry Pi will boot directly into the Desktop GUI with automatic login, and VNC will be enabled, allowing you to connect using RealVNC® Viewer.
