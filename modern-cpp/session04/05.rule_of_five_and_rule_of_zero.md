## Introduction

Managing resources (memory, file handles, network connections) in C++ requires careful attention to object lifetime. C++ offers special member functions for copying, moving, and destruction. Over time, two complementary guidelines emerged:

- **Rule of Five**: If you explicitly declare one of the five special member functions, you usually need to declare all five.
- **Rule of Zero**: Design your classes to avoid manual resource management altogether, relying on RAII types and letting the compiler generate special members.

Understanding both helps you choose the right balance between control and simplicity.

---

## The Rule of Three

Before C++11 introduced move semantics, the **Rule of Three** stated:

1. Destructor
2. Copy constructor
3. Copy assignment operator

If your class manages a resource (e.g., raw pointer), and you custom-define one, you should custom-define all three to avoid shallow copies or resource leaks.

---

## The Rule of Five

With C++11, move semantics added two more special members:

1. **Move constructor**
2. **Move assignment operator**

Thus, the Rule of Five:

1. **Destructor**
2. **Copy constructor**
3. **Copy assignment operator**
4. **Move constructor**
5. **Move assignment operator**

### Special‑Member Functions Overview Table

| If you declare       | Copy Ctor | Copy Assign | Move Ctor | Move Assign | Destructor |
| -------------------- | :-------: | :---------: | :-------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| **Copy constructor** |  Custom   |  =default   |  =delete  |   =delete   |  =default  |
| **Copy assignment**  | =default  |   Custom    |  =delete  |   =delete   |  =default  |
| **Move constructor** |  =delete  |   =delete   |  Custom   |   =delete   |  =default  |
| **Move assignment**  |  =delete  |   =delete   |  =delete  |   Custom    |  =default  |
| **Destructor**       | =default  |  =default   |  =delete  |   =delete   |   Custom   |
| **None declared**    | =default  |  =default   | =default  |  =default   |  =default  |

> **Explanation:**
>
> - `=default` means the compiler provides the default implementation.
> - `=delete` prevents that operation from being used.
> - **Custom** means you must provide your own implementation.

#### Quick‑Code Demonstrations

- **=default** example:

  ```cpp
  struct S {
    S(const S&) = default;      // use generated copy ctor
    S& operator=(const S&) = default;
  };
  ```

- **=delete** example:

  ```cpp
  struct NoCopy {
    NoCopy(const NoCopy&) = delete;            // disable copying
    NoCopy& operator=(const NoCopy&) = delete;
  };
  ```

- **Custom** placeholder example:

  ```cpp
  struct MyResource {
    MyResource(const MyResource& other) { /* deep copy logic */ }
    // ... implement other 4 special members ...
  };
  ```

### Copy Constructor

```cpp
MyClass(const MyClass& other)
  : data_(new int(*other.data_)) {}
```

Allocates new memory and copies the value.

### Copy Assignment Operator

```cpp
MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
        delete data_;
        data_ = new int(*other.data_);
    }
    return *this;
}
```

Frees existing resource and deep copies.

### Move Constructor

```cpp
MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept
  : data_(other.data_) {
    other.data_ = nullptr;
}
```

Steals the pointer and nulls out the source.

### Move Assignment Operator

```cpp
MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
    if (this != &other) {
        delete data_;
        data_ = other.data_;
        other.data_ = nullptr;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

Releases current resource, then steals.

### Destructor

```cpp
~MyClass() {
    delete data_;
}
```

Releases managed memory.

## The Rule of Zero

The Rule of Zero advocates **avoiding** manual resource management in your own classes. Instead, use existing RAII types (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::string`, smart pointers). Then:

```cpp
struct MyClass {
    std::unique_ptr<int> data_;  // RAII type; no custom members needed
};
```

No need to define any of the five special members; the compiler-generated ones correctly handle copy/move/destruction.

---

## Benefits and Trade-offs

| Rule         | Pros                                                         | Cons                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Rule of Five | Full control over resource semantics; efficient moves/copies | Verbose; error-prone; maintenance overhead   |
| Rule of Zero | Simpler code; safer (RAII handles cleanup); less boilerplate | Slight indirection; depends on library types |

---

## When to Apply Which Rule

- **Rule of Zero**: Default choice. Use when your class manages resources that have RAII wrappers.
- **Rule of Five**: Use only when you must manage resources manually (legacy APIs, custom allocators).

---

## Code Examples

### Rule of Five Example

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

class Buffer {
    int* data_;
    size_t size_;
public:
    Buffer(size_t size)
      : data_(new int[size]), size_(size) {}

    ~Buffer() { delete[] data_; }

    // Copy
    Buffer(const Buffer& other)
      : data_(new int[other.size_]), size_(other.size_) {
        std::copy(other.data_, other.data_ + size_, data_);
    }

    Buffer& operator=(const Buffer& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data_;
            size_ = other.size_;
            data_ = new int[size_];
            std::copy(other.data_, other.data_ + size_, data_);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Move
    Buffer(Buffer&& other) noexcept
      : data_(other.data_), size_(other.size_) {
        other.data_ = nullptr; other.size_ = 0;
    }

    Buffer& operator=(Buffer&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete[] data_;
            data_ = other.data_;
            size_ = other.size_;
            other.data_ = nullptr; other.size_ = 0;
        }
        return *this;
    }
};
```

### Rule of Zero Example

```cpp
#include <vector>

struct Buffer {
    std::vector<int> data_;  // RAII-managed

    Buffer(size_t size) : data_(size) {}
};

// Compiler-generated copy/move/destructor are correct.
```

## Best Practices

- Prefer **Rule of Zero**: leverage standard containers and smart pointers.
- If you manage raw resources:

  - Follow **Rule of Five** strictly.
  - Mark move operations `noexcept`.
  - Use copy-and-swap or strong exception safety idioms.

- Document ownership semantics clearly.
