# Introduction to Class Pointers

Pointers to class types are fundamental in C++ for dynamic memory management, callbacks, and polymorphism. A pointer to a class holds the address of an object, allowing indirect access to its members. When used with inheritance, a base-class pointer can refer to derived-class objects, enabling runtime polymorphism and code flexibility.

This README covers:

- How to declare and use pointers to classes
- Using base-class pointers to hold derived-class objects (upcasting)
- Static vs. dynamic binding and virtual functions
- Object slicing and how to avoid it
- Safe downcasting with `dynamic_cast`
- Smart pointers in an inheritance context
- Pointer-to-member data and member functions
- Advanced patterns: CRTP and callback registries
- Common pitfalls and best practices
- Hands-on exercises for practice

## Declaring and Using Class Pointers

A pointer to a class type is declared using the `*` operator. You use `->` to access members via a pointer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() const { std::cout << "Animal eats\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal a;
    Animal* p = &a;       // pointer to object
    p->eat();             // calls Animal::eat
    (*p).eat();           // equivalent via dereference
    return 0;
}
```

- `Animal* p = &a;` stores the address of `a`.
- `p->eat();` is syntactic sugar for `(*p).eat();`.

## Base-Class Pointer to Derived Objects

When a class `Derived` inherits from `Base`, you can assign a `Derived*` to a `Base*` (upcasting). This is safe because every `Derived` object "is a" `Base`.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void greet() const { std::cout << "Hello from Base\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void shout() const { std::cout << "Derived here!\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    Base* bp = &d;        // upcast: Derived* → Base*
    bp->greet();          // OK: Base::greet
    // bp->shout();       // ERROR: Base* doesn’t know shout()
    return 0;
}
```

### Static Binding (Without `virtual`)

By default, calls through a base-class pointer use **static binding**, resolved at compile time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    void say() const { std::cout << "Base says hi\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void say() const { std::cout << "Derived says hi\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    Base* bp = &d;
    bp->say();            // always "Base says hi"
    return 0;
}
```

### Dynamic Binding (With `virtual`)

To enable runtime polymorphism, declare the base method `virtual`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual void say() const { std::cout << "Base says hi\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void say() const override { std::cout << "Derived says hi\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    Base* bp = &d;
    bp->say();            // prints "Derived says hi"
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Object Slicing

Assigning a derived object to a base object by value _slices_ off the derived parts:

```cpp
Derived d;
Base b = d;    // slicing: b is a pure Base
b.say();       // calls Base::say, no Derived data
```

**Avoid slicing** by using pointers or references instead of by-value assignments when polymorphism is needed.

---

## Safe Downcasting with `dynamic_cast`

When you only have a `Base*`, you can test if it actually points to a `Derived` using `dynamic_cast`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base { public: virtual ~Base() = default; };
class Derived : public Base { public: void shout() const { std::cout << "Derived here\n"; } };

void foo(Base* bp) {
    if (auto dp = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(bp)) {
        dp->shout();  // safe: only if bp is actually Derived*
    } else {
        std::cout << "Not a Derived\n";
    }
}
```

---

## Smart Pointers and Inheritance

Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage dynamic objects safely.

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = default;
    virtual void info() const { std::cout << "Base\n"; }
};
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void info() const override { std::cout << "Derived\n"; }
};

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<Base> up = std::make_unique<Derived>();
    up->info();  // Derived

    std::shared_ptr<Base> sp = std::make_shared<Derived>();
    sp->info();  // Derived
    return 0;
}
```

## Pointer-to-Member Data & Functions

### Member Data Pointer Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

int main() {
    Person p{"Alice",30};
    // pointer to member data
    std::string Person::* ptrName = &Person::name;
    std::cout << p.*ptrName << " is " << p.age << " yrs\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Member Function Pointer Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Greeter {
public:
    void greet() const { std::cout << "Hello!\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Greeter g;
    // pointer to member function
    void (Greeter::*ptrGreet)() const = &Greeter::greet;
    (g.*ptrGreet)();  // calls greet()
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Advanced: Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)

Leverage static polymorphism without virtual overhead.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename Derived>
class BaseCRTP {
public:
    void interface() { static_cast<Derived*>(this)->implementation(); }
};

class Impl : public BaseCRTP<Impl> {
public:
    void implementation() { std::cout << "CRTP impl\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Impl i;
    i.interface();  // calls Impl::implementation
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Callback Registry with Pointers

Use pointers to member functions for event callbacks.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Button {
    using Callback = void(*)();
    std::vector<Callback> callbacks;
public:
    void onClick(Callback cb) { callbacks.push_back(cb); }
    void click() { for(auto cb:callbacks) cb(); }
};

void handler1() { std::cout << "Handler1\n"; }
void handler2() { std::cout << "Handler2\n"; }

int main() {
    Button btn;
    btn.onClick(handler1);
    btn.onClick(handler2);
    btn.click();  // both handlers
    return 0;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Non-virtual destructor:** Always declare a virtual destructor in polymorphic bases.
- **Slicing:** Avoid passing/returning polymorphic objects by value.
- **Dangling pointers:** Use smart pointers to manage lifetimes.
- **`override` keyword:** Prevent mismatches in overrides.
- **Pointer-to-member syntax:** Memorize `Class::*` and `(obj.*ptr)(...)` forms.

## Exercises

1. **Basic Pointer Use:** Declare a `Shape` base class and a `Square` derived class. Create objects and pointers, and call methods using `->` and `*`.
2. **Upcasting/Downcasting:** Write functions taking `Base*` and test upcasting and safe downcasting with `dynamic_cast`.
3. **Polymorphic Collection:** Store different derived objects in a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Base>>` and iterate to call a virtual method.
4. **Slicing Demonstration:** Show slicing by assigning a derived object to a base object and explain the output.
5. **Pointer-to-Member:** Use a pointer to member function to store multiple `greet()` callbacks in a container.
6. **CRTP Variation:** Extend the CRTP example with two implementations and call their `interface()`.
