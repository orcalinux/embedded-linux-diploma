# LinkedList Memory Profiling & Leak Detection Guide

A C++ implementation of a singly-linked list, with step-by-step instructions to compile, detect memory leaks, and visualize memory usage on Linux using Valgrind, Massif-Visualizer, and Heaptrack. Ideal for Eclipse-based workflows.

## Project Structure

```text
LinkedList/
├── include/
│   └── LinkedList.hpp      # Class declaration
├── src/
│   ├── LinkedList.cpp      # Class definition
│   └── main.cpp            # Test driver
└── LinkedList              # Executable (after build)
```

---

## Prerequisites

Install the following on your Ubuntu (or Debian-based) system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++ valgrind massif-visualizer heaptrack
```

- **g++** – C++ compiler
- **Valgrind** – memcheck & Massif
- **Massif-Visualizer** – GUI for Massif output
- **Heaptrack** – detailed heap profiler

---

## Building with Debug Symbols

From the project root (`LinkedList/`), compile with `-g`:

```bash
g++ -g \
    -Iinclude \
    src/LinkedList.cpp src/main.cpp \
    -o LinkedList
```

- `-Iinclude` points to the header directory.
- `-g` enables debug info for profilers.

Verify:

```bash
ls -l LinkedList
```

---

## Running the Executable

Quick smoke test:

```bash
./LinkedList
```

Ensure it runs without crashing before profiling.

---

## Memory Leak Detection with Valgrind

Valgrind’s Memcheck flags leaks and invalid memory use.

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./LinkedList
```

- **`--leak-check=full`**: detailed leak reports
- **`--show-leak-kinds=all`**: includes “definitely”, “indirectly”, “possibly” lost

**Interpreting the report**

```text
==1234== 16 bytes in 2 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==1234==    at 0x4C2DB8F: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:334)
==1234==    by 0x4009A2: LinkedList::add(int) (LinkedList.cpp:15)
```

- Look for **“definitely lost”** blocks.
- Trace the call stack to your code, then fix missing `delete` logic (e.g., in the destructor).

Rebuild and re-run until Valgrind reports **0 bytes** lost.

---

## Profiling with Massif & Massif-Visualizer

Massif tracks heap usage over time. By default it samples every N instructions, which may miss rapid deallocations; to see the full “triangle” (ramp up and ramp down), use `--time-unit=B` (bytes).

1. **Record a default profile** (instruction-based sampling):

   ```bash
   valgrind --tool=massif ./LinkedList
   ```

2. **Record a byte-based profile** (one sample per alloc/dealloc):

   ```bash
   valgrind --tool=massif --time-unit=B ./LinkedList
   ```

3. **Locate output**:

   ```bash
   ls massif.out.*
   ```

4. **Visualize**:

   ```bash
   massif-visualizer massif.out.<pid>
   ```

   - **Toggle Total Cost Graph**: shows the overall heap curve.
   - **Toggle Detailed Cost Graph**: breaks out per‐allocator stacks.
   - Using `--time-unit=B`, you will see:

     - A **linear ramp up** as each `new Node` is called.
     - A **flat peak** while the list is full.
     - A **linear ramp down** as your destructor `clear()` frees every node.

## Detailed Profiling with Heaptrack

Heaptrack captures every allocation with a rich GUI.

1. **Record profile**:

   ```bash
   heaptrack ./LinkedList
   ```

   Generates `heaptrack.LinkedList.<timestamp>.gz`.

2. **Visualize**:

   ```bash
   heaptrack_gui heaptrack.LinkedList.<timestamp>.gz
   ```

   - **Consumed** tab: overall heap usage curve (rise & fall).
   - **Allocations** / **Largest Memory Leaks**: pinpoints unfreed blocks.

3. **Iterate**:

   - Fix leaks in code (destructor, missing `delete`).
   - Re-run Heaptrack to confirm **0 bytes leaked** and a clean ramp-down.

---

## Best Practices

- **Smart pointers**: prefer `std::unique_ptr<Node>` to auto-manage heap memory.
- **Rule of Three/Five**: implement destructor, copy/move constructors, and assignments if you manage raw pointers.
- **Continuous testing**: integrate Valgrind into CI to catch leaks early.
- **Suppressions**: use suppression files for third-party noise:

  ```bash
  valgrind --suppressions=valgrind.supp --leak-check=full ./LinkedList
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No executable**: ensure build command succeeded and `LinkedList` exists.
- **Valgrind crashes**: fix any invalid memory accesses reported first.
- **No Massif output**: verify the program runs to completion.
- **GUI won’t open**: confirm `massif-visualizer`/`heaptrack_gui` are installed and dependencies are met.

---

## Example Leak Scenario

```cpp
// LinkedList.cpp (bad destructor)
LinkedList::~LinkedList() {
    // missing node deletion → memory leak
}
```

Valgrind will report “definitely lost” blocks for each `new Node`. Fix by:

```cpp
LinkedList::~LinkedList() {
    while (head) {
        auto temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
    }
}
```
