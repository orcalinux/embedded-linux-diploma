# Simple Smart-Pointers for `int`: `UniqueIntPtr` & `SharedIntPtr`

This guide shows two minimal, **non-template** smart-pointer classes specialized for `int*`.
They illustrate core C++ principles—**RAII**, move semantics, and reference counting—without the complexity of templates.

> **RAII** (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) ties resource management (allocation & deallocation) to object lifetime: when a smart-pointer is constructed it acquires ownership, and when it is destroyed its destructor automatically cleans up.

## Problem with Raw Pointers

Using raw `new`/`delete` directly for heap-allocated arrays or objects leads to several common bugs:

- **Memory Leaks**
  Forgetting to call `delete[]` in every code path (especially on exceptions) leaves memory permanently allocated.

- **Dangling Pointers / Double Deletes**
  Copying a raw pointer twice and then calling `delete[]` twice crashes your program.

- **Exception Safety**
  If a constructor throws after allocating memory, you must remember to clean up—otherwise leaks occur.

- **Unclear Ownership**
  It’s easy to lose track of who is responsible for calling `delete[]`. Bugs multiply as code grows.

## Our Solution: Smart-Pointer Classes

Instead of raw pointers, we will implement two small helper classes that **replace** `int*` with types that enforce:

- **Automatic cleanup** (RAII)
- **Clear ownership rules**
- **Safe copy/move semantics**

We introduce:

1. **`UniqueIntPtr`** – for exclusive, move-only ownership
2. **`SharedIntPtr`** – for reference-counted, shared ownership

---

## 1. `UniqueIntPtr`: Exclusive Ownership

A `UniqueIntPtr` wraps a single `int*` so that:

- Only one `UniqueIntPtr` ever owns that pointer.
- Ownership can be **transferred** with move operations.
- When the `UniqueIntPtr` is destroyed, it automatically calls `delete` on the pointer.
- Copying is disabled to prevent accidental sharing.

### UniqueIntPtr Key Properties

1. **Move-Only**

   - Copy constructor and copy assignment are deleted.
   - Move constructor/assignment transfer ownership, leaving the source empty.

2. **RAII Cleanup**

   - Destructor calls `delete ptr_`.
   - Ensures no memory leak—even if an exception is thrown.

3. **Ownership Management**

   - `get()`: access the raw pointer.
   - `release()`: relinquish ownership without deleting, returning raw pointer.
   - `reset(p)`: delete the old pointer (if any) and take ownership of `p`.

### `UniqueIntPtr.hpp`

```cpp
#ifndef UNIQUE_INT_PTR_HPP
#define UNIQUE_INT_PTR_HPP

class UniqueIntPtr {
public:
    explicit UniqueIntPtr(int* p = nullptr) noexcept;
    ~UniqueIntPtr();

    // Move-only: disable copy
    UniqueIntPtr(UniqueIntPtr&&) noexcept;
    UniqueIntPtr& operator=(UniqueIntPtr&&) noexcept;
    UniqueIntPtr(const UniqueIntPtr&) = delete;
    UniqueIntPtr& operator=(const UniqueIntPtr&) = delete;

    // Observers
    int*  get()    const noexcept;
    int*  release() noexcept;
    void  reset(int* p = nullptr) noexcept;

    int& operator*()  const noexcept;
    int* operator->() const noexcept;
    explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

private:
    int* ptr_;
};

#endif // UNIQUE_INT_PTR_HPP
```

---

## 2. `SharedIntPtr`: Shared Ownership

A `SharedIntPtr` wraps a pointer plus a simple reference counter so that:

- Many `SharedIntPtr` instances can point to the same `int*`.
- Copying increments the counter; destruction decrements it.
- The pointer is deleted only when the last owner goes away.
- Move operations transfer the pointer without altering the reference count.

### SharedIntPtr Key Properties

1. **Copyable & Moveable**

   - Copy constructor/assignment bump the count.
   - Move constructor/assignment transfer pointer & counter, leaving source empty.

2. **Automatic Deletion**

   - Destructor decrements count; when it reaches zero, deletes both the `int*` and the counter.

3. **Utilities**

   - `use_count()`: how many owners currently exist.
   - `reset(p)`: drop current pointer (possibly deleting) and start new count for `p`.
   - `swap(other)`: exchange pointers and counters without affecting counts.

### `SharedIntPtr.hpp`

```cpp
#ifndef SHARED_INT_PTR_HPP
#define SHARED_INT_PTR_HPP

#include <cstddef>
#include <utility>

class SharedIntPtr {
public:
    explicit SharedIntPtr(int* p = nullptr);
    SharedIntPtr(const SharedIntPtr& o);
    SharedIntPtr(SharedIntPtr&& o) noexcept;
    SharedIntPtr& operator=(const SharedIntPtr& o);
    SharedIntPtr& operator=(SharedIntPtr&& o) noexcept;
    ~SharedIntPtr();

    // Observers
    int*        get()       const noexcept;
    std::size_t use_count() const noexcept;
    explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

    // Modifiers
    void        reset(int* p = nullptr);
    void        swap(SharedIntPtr& o) noexcept;

    int& operator*()  const noexcept;
    int* operator->() const noexcept;

private:
    int* ptr_;
    int* counter_;  // holds heap-allocated ref count
    void release() noexcept;
};

#endif // SHARED_INT_PTR_HPP
```

## 3. Putting It All Together: Usage

```cpp
#include "UniqueIntPtr.hpp"
#include "SharedIntPtr.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // UniqueIntPtr example
    {
        UniqueIntPtr u{ new int(99) };
        std::cout << "Unique holds " << *u << "\n";
        // no delete needed: destructor frees memory
    }

    // SharedIntPtr example
    SharedIntPtr s1{ new int(123) };
    SharedIntPtr s2 = s1;
    std::cout << "Shared use_count=" << s1.use_count() << "\n"; // 2
    // both s1 and s2 point to the same int
    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Key Takeaways

- Raw pointers are powerful but **error-prone**.
- `UniqueIntPtr` and `SharedIntPtr` enforce clear ownership rules and automate cleanup.
- These classes demonstrate the **mechanics** behind `std::unique_ptr<int>` and `std::shared_ptr<int>`, giving you hands-on insight into RAII, move semantics, and reference counting.
